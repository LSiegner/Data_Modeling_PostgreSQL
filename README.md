### Data Modeling with Postgresql
---
This project uses the Million Song Dataset to create a database for a fictional company sparkify. For this project a star schema database was created, which was designed for OLAP purposes, e.g. run CRUD queries using Postgresql. So that the fictional company sparkify is able to answer basic questions, such as when are the most logins happening, what are the most popular songs, what is the average listening time to a song etc. However this database only covers the actions of users, when listening to songs and not transactions or payments or any other monetary related subject. Therefore it is really just designed to answer questions regarding customer behaviour inside the app.
